# web3 room game

Changed my idea to test out how to code contract/s that keep track of individual movements in a room or collection of rooms. Needed to test out a few things with this concept.

#### Some plans

1. A NFT contract to track players/pieces/items.
2. A contract to track location of players/items and grid system.
3. Library to validate movement.
4. Rewards contract.

#### Initial Drawing Board Idea
Chess using smart contracts.
